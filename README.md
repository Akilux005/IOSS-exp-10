A.2--- Prerequisite: 
LibreOffice - formerly known as OpenOffice.org – is a freely available suite of office applications that you 
can download and install for free without any copyright infringement.OpenOffice.org has been taken over 
by Oracle and is no longer open-source software. LibreOffice suite was developed in 2010 by The 
Document Foundation – a non-profit organisation that promotes open-source document handling software. 
LibreOffice suite is a fork of OpenOffice, meaning the underlying source code is the same, but the software
has gone in a different development direction. LibreOffice is a comprehensive, professional-quality office 
tool available in more than 114 languages and for all major operating systems, including Microsoft 
Windows, FreeBSD, Mac OSX and Linux (Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Mandriva, Suse, ...). LibreOffice is 
user-friendly. It offers a simple-to-use yet powerful interface that is easy to personalise. Its native file format 
is Open Document Format (ODF), an open standard format. Since it stores data in an international open 
standard format, it is therefore compatible with all major file formats.
LibreOffice Components
LibreOffice suite components include word process, spreadsheet, presentation graphics
and database, drawing and math tools.
